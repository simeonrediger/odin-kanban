# Assignment
- Tasks
    - are objects
    - are created
        - dynamically
    -   - with factories or constructors/classes
    - at least have a
        - title
        - description
        - due date
        - and priority
    - may also include
        - notes
        - or a checklist
- Projects/Lists (Project > List > Task)
    - are groups of tasks
    - can be created by users
    - can be selected by users for tasks to go into
    - has a default instance
- Keep application and presentation logic in separate modules
- Interface
    - View all projects
    - View all tasks in each project
        - Probably just the titles
        - and due dates
        - maybe priority color-coding
    - Expand a single task to see/edit its details
    - Delete a task
- Consider installing date-fns
    - for formatting and manipulating dates and times
- Persistence
    - Use the Web Storage API
    - Create a function that saves projects (and tasks) to `localStorage`
        - for each new project created
        - for each task created
    - Create a function that gets data from `localStorage` on page load
    - Make sure the app doesn't crash if there is no data to get
    - You can inspect `localStorage` in dev tools
    - Remember that `localStorage` uses JSON to send and store data
        - Functions cannot be stored in JSON data
        - Figure out how to add methods back to objects once you fetch them

# Organization
- Use subdirectories and barrel modules as complexity increases
- `services/storage.js` for `localStorage`
- `components/` for UI component JS and CSS
- `utils/` for generic helper functions
    - Colocate?
- `public/` for non-imported assets; `assets/` for imported assets
    - `create-new-list.svg` dynamic or hidden/unhidden?
- Maybe use `validation/` for global/shared validation (or `validators/`?)

# Design
- How should name validation work if it's for JSON compatibility? (SRP?)
    - Is that actually the core validation purpose?
    - If so, what about injecting storage and input into a validator?
- Should each class in the task hierarchy validate its own name?
    - `Board` validates `Board` name
    - `List` validates `List` name
    - `Task` validates `Task` name
- Or should a parent validate its children's names?
    - `workspace` validates names in `boards`
    - `Board` validates names in `lists`
    - `List` validates names in `tasks`
- Or should the topmost class validate all names?
    - `workspace` validates names in `boards`, `lists`, and `tasks`
